### Data Structures & Algorithms Practice

#### Build Instructions
###### Swift
  - clone the repo
  - make sure that you have Swift 3.0 installed
  - `cd` into one of the Swift directories (camelCased dir names)
  - run `swift build` to build the project
  - `swift test` runs the test suites

###### Clojure
  - clone the repo
  - `cd` into any of the Clojure repos (kebab-cased dir names)
  - `lein spec` will run the tests

#### Overview
This repo is used as practice for learning the various data structures and algorithms that are out there.
In order to really understand how these algorithms are implemented, I decided to first implement the
algorithm in Swift using an imperative/object-oriented approach, then I implement the algorithm
in Clojure using a functional, immutable appraoch.

The imperative solutions are heavily influenced from the [Swift Algorithms Club repo](https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-algorithm-club).
